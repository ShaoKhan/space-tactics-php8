# space-tactics-php8
Try to work on the base of the 2moons browsergame with the new php version with symfony and twig

- Since the old version runs under php7 and was developed for php5 it is now time to shift it to the new php version and try to use some new methods.
-- I'll tried to refactor the old code, but i think it takes too much time, so i give symfony a chance :)
- symfony is new to me, so dont be rude, if something wont fit to you.

- if you've been interested to support this project with code or ui/ux skills, you are very welcome.

# tech specs
- php 8.1
- phpstorm
- symfony 6.2
- twig
- bootstrap
- jquery

feel free to ask.
